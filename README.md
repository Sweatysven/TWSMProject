# TWSMProject

Project title:
The title of our website is considered to be “TWSM Project”.

General:
The overall purpose of the website is to enable the developers to illustrate some of the key topics that was covered during the TWSM course lectures, and to demonstrate how the different technologies i.e. HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap, can be combined for different purposes. In general we want to present each web technology in short and additionally show exercises attached to each web technology and how to solve the exercises. The idea is to develop this interactive website where users can edit, write and output their own code to solve the different exercises presented in class. Thus it becomes a page about teaching the different web technologies, much like the website listed below: 
https://www.w3schools.com/ 

Overall we present the following web technologies this website will include: HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap. At this point, we do no exclude other web technologies to be incorporated into the making of our website.

Considered structure of the website:
The main idea, in regards to the structure of the website, is to create specific “clickable” categories representing the different technologies included in the project. Each category will then present several subcategories, which then includes/showcases the different TWSM exercises that was solved, using the respective technologies. The users should then resolve these exercises by the use of an online editor. For each exercise, this online editor will contain some prewritten code the user can edit and try out to figure out each exercise.

Considered approach: 
There exist different online editors that could be used to write code on a website. See link below. A considered idea is to use an online editor, during the presentation of the project, in order to dynamically display how changed variables affect the outcome of the specific exercise.
